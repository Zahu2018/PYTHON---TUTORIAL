ERRORS AND EXCEPTION
====================

Type of error
-------------

COMMISION - {Greseli Logice} - eroneous output, app. stop brusc, dialog boxes, freeze comp, data damage;
OMMISION  - incorrect info input by user, internet conexion, hardware, incompatim
SYNTACTIC - typo, case sensitive
SEMANTIC  - one more loop, wrong implementation
LOGIC     - gandire gresita, variabile neasteptate or nume de variabile gresite, input neasteptat, only hardisk instead of other devices, indentare la un nivel gresit, operator order is wrong, boolean mistakes

errno: eroare sub forma de nr. intreg
strerror: eroare sub forma de sir (human readable)

Exception Alphabeticaly
-----------------------

ArithmeticError: arithmetic error; attribute not found in object
AssertionError: the expression in the assert function is false; fail of declaration
AttributeError: the object does not have this attribute (value or method)
BaseException: a basic exception from which all the others originate
BlockingIOError:
BrokenPipeError:
BufferError: The operation associated with the buffer cannot be performed
ChildProcessError: failure during operation with a child process
ConnectionAbortedError:
ConnectionError: is the base class for connection exceptions
ConnectionRefusedError:
ConnectionResetError:
EOFError: try to read before EOF; the function came across the end of the file and was unable to read what it wanted
Exception: and here already completely system exceptions (which are better not to touch) already end and ordinary ones with which you can work begin.
FileExistsError: An attempt to create a file or directory that already exists
FileNotFoundError: file or directory does not exist
FloatingPointError: when a floating point operation fails. Rarelly.
GeneratorExit: when the close method of the generator obj. is called
IOError: I/O operation fail (file not found, ...)
ImportError: import of the module or its attribute failed
IndentationError: Indentation is incorrect
IndexError: try to access and index that not exist; the index is not in the range of elements
InterruptedError: A system call is interrupted by an incoming signal
IsADirectoryError: a file was expected, but this is a directory
KeyboardInterrupt: when interrupts a prog. (usually with Ctrl + C).
KeyError: a nonexistent key (in a dictionary , set, or other object); key in dict not found
LookupError: invalid index or key
MemoryError: Not enough memory
NameError: a variable with the same name was not found; a name of idetifier (var, funct) not found
NotADirectoryError: a directory was expected, but this is a file
NotImplementedError: occurs when abstract class methods require overriding in child classes
OSError: system related error
OverflowError: value to big to be represented; when result of an arithmetic operation is too large to represent. Does not appear during normal work with integers (since python supports long numbers), but may occur in some other cases.
PermissionError: not enough access rights
ProcessLookupError: not enough access rights
ReferenceError: An attempt to access an attribute with a weak reference
RuntimeError: division with0, operation with var of different type, accessing what not exist, run out of memory; occurs when the exception does not fall into any of the other categories
StopIteration: the built-in next func. if there are'n more elem. in iter.
SyntaxError: syntax error
SystemError: is an internal error
SystemExit: thrown by the sys.exit func. when exit the program.
TabError: blending indentation tabs and spaces
TimeoutError: timeout expired
TypeError: operation with var of different type (int+str); The operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type
UnboundLocalError: try to access a var before setting ; a reference has been made to a local variable in a function, but the variable has not been previously defined
UnicodeEncodeError: An exception related to unicode encoding
UnicodeDecodeError: An exception related to unicode decoding
UnicodeError: error related to encoding / decoding of unicode in strings
UnicodeTranslateError: is an exception related to unicode translation
ValueError: variable are the same type but value differ; the function receives an argument of the correct type, but an incorrect value
ZeroDivisionError: try to divide with 0; division by zero
